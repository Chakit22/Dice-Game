# Dice-Game
1. A pretty simple game built using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
2. Used random number generator to generate numbers between 1 to 6 on the two dices representing two participants and the one with the higher number wins and the other loses.
3. Each time the page is refreshed, a random number is generated on the two dices.
If both of them have the same random number generated then the game results in a tie.
